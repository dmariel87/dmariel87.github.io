	<p>Food Photography became a love of mine in 2016. I would always go to different restaurants as a form of entertainment either by myself or with friends. There was always a restaurant opening up and I've always been the type to want to explore. I finally started posting my food on different social media platforms. I had several friends who enjoyed when I did theis and they started asking me where I was going and what I thought of the experiences. I was happy to oblige but wanted a way to have even more experiences. That's when I discovered Yelp. Yelp is a website where you can find different restaurants, venues, parks etc etc and real people make real reviews. <br><br>
	When I discovred Yelp my whole midset changed. I wanted to get to as many restaurants or venues as possible and tell people about my experiences. I did this for the next few years but it wasn't until 2019 that I really started to take the photography aspect seriously and do less of the actual review. It is my hope that in the next few months with the help of my personal blog that I will expand my reach and possibly do a guest article on <a href="https://www.foodbeast.com/" target="_blank">foodbeast</a></p>
